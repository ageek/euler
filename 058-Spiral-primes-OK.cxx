//Spiral primes
//Problem 58
//
//Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
//
//37 36 35 34 33 32 31
//38 17 16 15 14 13 30
//39 18  5  4  3 12 29
//40 19  6  1  2 11 28
//41 20  7  8  9 10 27
//42 21 22 23 24 25 26
//43 44 45 46 47 48 49
//
//It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
//
//If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
//
//Refer Prob 28 (clockwise spiral problem) for details:
//core algo for Prob 58: 
//1. base =1 for layer/level =1 (the innnermost element)
//2. layer=2 onwards, we need to find the first element(dependent on the last element of last layer) and the remaining
//   3 are equidistant, delta  of which is dependent on the layer no
//3. for each layer, find the 1st, 1st+delta, 1st+2*delta, 1st+3*delta and keep track of how many diagonal elements are prime
//4. loop till prime ration < 10%, print layer
//
//Note: 1.ratio is around 13% till layer 1113 and with 5 million primes. Faster approach would be to test primality of corner elements instread of generating 
//      5 million + primes
//      2. a faster primality testing algo will lead to an efficient solution. 
//      3. One option would be to use Miller Rabin Test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test 
//      4. Naive primality testing is decently fast. On my 2GB RAM, 1CPU VM it takes <1.5s to spit out the answer
